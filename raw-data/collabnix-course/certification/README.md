# Terraform Certification Guide

The Terraform Associate certification is for Cloud Engineers specializing in operations, IT, or development who know the basic concepts and skills associated with open source HashiCorp Terraform. Candidates will be best prepared for this exam if they have professional experience using Terraform in production, but performing the exam objectives in a personal demo environment may also be sufficient. This person understands which enterprise features exist and what can and cannot be done using the open source offering.

The exam objective has 9 modules. The questions will cover all the modules and you will get a scorecard for each module. The number of questions varies from a person to person. In my case, I got 57 questions.
