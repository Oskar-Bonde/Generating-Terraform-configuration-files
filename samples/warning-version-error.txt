Warning: Quoted references are deprecated
on main.tf line 34, in resource "aws_eip" "name_3": 
34:   depends_on = ["aws_internet_gateway.name_1"]
    In this context, references are expected literally rather than in quotes. Terraform 0.11 and earlier        
    required quotes, but quoted references are now deprecated and will be removed in a future version of        
    Terraform. Remove the quotes surrounding this reference to silence this warning.
